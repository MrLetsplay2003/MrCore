**This readme is currently outdated and needs to be updated**

This is a simple to use library to make life easier, both for developers and users

The newest version currently includes:
- HttpUtils: Create simple Http post/get requests
- OtherTools: This is still to be moved into other classes. Nothing in here is solid! This may include work-in-progress or experimental features that aren't guaranteed to stay
- CustomConfig: A config system that's designed to be easy both for developers and users. It's based on YAML, but has been simplified and uses UTF-8 encoding, so you have a much better user experience

Pull requests are welcome and will help improve the library even more!
